**Next Word Prediction System**
**Overview**
The Next Word Prediction System is an NLP-based application that provides dynamic word and sentence suggestions while users type, similar to autocomplete features found in search engines. The project integrates LSTM models with custom-trained Word2Vec embeddings to enhance the accuracy and relevance of predictions.

**Features**
Real-time Word and Sentence Suggestions

Displayed dynamically as the user types.
Both predicted words and relevant sentences are shown for context.
Users can click on suggestions to append them to their input.
Display Input Functionality

A button allows users to submit and print the final typed sentence below the input field.
Modern UI and Responsive Design

Clean interface with enhanced CSS.
Real-time communication with the backend using REST API.

**Technologies Used**
Python
Flask – Backend framework
TensorFlow/Keras – LSTM model for predictions
Gensim (Word2Vec) – Custom-trained word embeddings
HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Frontend
Pickle – For tokenization management

**Architecture**
1. Frontend
Handles user input and displays suggestions dynamically.
Provides a clean and responsive interface.
2. Backend (Flask API)
Receives user input and returns top-n predicted words and relevant sentences.
Uses LSTM models stored in next_word.h5.
Word2Vec embeddings (w2v_model.model) enhance predictions.
Pickle-based tokenizer loads from tokenizer.pkl.
3. Prediction Logic
The backend function predict_top_n_words_lstm():
Encodes input using the tokenizer.
Pads input to ensure consistent length.
Predicts the next words using the LSTM model.
Fetches relevant sentences from the corpus for context-based suggestions.
Training Word2Vec with Custom Data
A custom Word2Vec model was trained on a domain-specific dataset to enhance prediction relevance. Using custom embeddings ensures that the system aligns better with the expected vocabulary and context. This makes it more effective than using generic pre-trained embeddings.

**Challenges Faced**
Model Accuracy:
Tuning the LSTM and Word2Vec models to achieve meaningful predictions.
Unicode Errors:
Addressed issues with Word2Vec binary loading by switching to .model format.
Real-time Suggestions:
Managed seamless interaction between the frontend and backend for live suggestions.
Future Improvements
Enhanced Model Performance:
Explore BERT or GPT for improved predictions.
Sentence Completion:
Extend the system to predict entire sentences or phrases.
Multilingual Support:
Implement models for multiple languages.
User Feedback Loop:
Add feedback mechanisms to improve predictions over time.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd next-word-prediction
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train or place your Word2Vec model in the models/ directory:

Example: models/w2v_model.model
Ensure your LSTM model and tokenizer are also placed in the models/ directory:

Example: models/next_word.h5 and models/tokenizer.pkl
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code

**Usage**
Start typing in the input box to see real-time suggestions for words and sentences.
Click on any suggestion to append it to the input text.
Once you finish typing, click the Submit button to display the sentence below the input box.
Conclusion
The Next Word Prediction System combines custom-trained Word2Vec embeddings and an LSTM model to provide meaningful word predictions and sentence suggestions in real time. This project demonstrates the practical application of NLP for text prediction and can be extended to chatbots, typing assistants, or auto-complete tools.
